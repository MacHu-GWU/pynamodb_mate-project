    "# Enable status tracking for business critical application using Amazon DynamoDB\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we introduce a pattern for tracking the status of business critical tasks using Amazon DynamoDB as the backend. This feature gives you the ability to track status of each task, and error-handling, retry, concurrency control out-of-the-box.\n",
    "\n",
    "When managing a large number of business-critical tasks, it is crucial to monitor and identify which tasks have been successful, which have failed, and which are still in progress. If the business logic is a pipeline consisting of a sequence of tasks, it is important to keep track of its current status and have the ability to recover from any failed task. We also have seen some advanced requirements from AWS customers that includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each task should be consumed once and exactly once.\n",
    "- Each task should be handled by only one worker, you want a concurrency lock mechanism to avoid double consumption.\n",
    "- For those succeeded tasks, store additional information such as the output, statistics, metadata of the task and log the success time.\n",
    "- For those failed tasks, you want to log the detailed error message for debugging.\n",
    "- You want to get all of the failed tasks by one simple query and rerun with the updated business logic.\n",
    "- Task might be impossible to complete. To avoid falling into an endless retry loop, you want to ignore the tasks if they fail too many times.\n",
    "- Run custom query based on task status for analytics purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "With [pynamodb_mate](https://github.com/MacHu-GWU/pynamodb_mate-project) Python library, you can enable this advanced feature without refactoring your existing application code, and you can use the \"elegant\" context manager to wrap around your business logic code and enjoy all the features above.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Real-World Example: Tracking Document Processing Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take an example and see how we use ``pynamodb_mate`` for status tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have to process thousands of PDF documents. For each document, we need to extract text and key-value data from it, and then we want to use LLM (Large Language Model) to answer some business questions based on the data we extracted. In this example, the task has two steps: \"extract data\" and \"answer business question\". We want to ensure that all the documents have been processed properly. We may distribute thousands of PDF documents to a swarm of workers and process them in parallel, but we only want one document to be worked on by one worker at a time. Since this job is complicated and the worker may fail, we want a retry mechanism to ensure that all the jobs have been processed eventually. However, it is possible that the input document is malformed, making it impossible to finish. We need to avoid deadlock and infinite retry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this example use case, I would like to define the following concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task and Task Id**: Each task that we want to track the status of. Each task has a unique ``task_id``. In this use case, the task ID is the document ID.\n",
    "- **Status Code**: The status of each task. The lifecycle of each task goes through the following process: ``pending`` -> ``in_progress`` -> ``failed/succeeded/ignored``. ``pending`` means the task is ready to be executed at any time, ``in_progress`` means the task is being executed, ``failed`` means the execution failed, ``succeeded`` means the execution was successful, and ``ignored`` means the task was ignored due to too many failed retries. ``pynamodb_mate`` doesn't allow adding any other status codes in this process. This is because the lifecycle corresponds to an idempotent operation. If you have other intermediate status operations in ``in_progress``, let's assume there are a total of 2 steps. In this case, you should split these 2 steps into two lifecycles. The status code for ``succeeded`` in the first step should be equal to the status code for ``pending`` in the second step. The reason for doing this is that once you have other intermediate status operations, your idempotency cannot be guaranteed, so you must split them into two steps. In this use case, the status codes for Step 1 are 10 for pending, 20 for in progress, 30 for failed, 40 for succeeded, and 50 for ignored (failed too many times, ignore it to avoid deadlock). For Step 2, 40 is for pending (Step 1 is succeeded), 70 is in progress, 80 is failed, 90 is succeeded, and 100 is ignored.\n",
    "- **Use Case and Use Case Id**: In DynamoDB, we often use a single table to do many things that would require multiple tables in relational databases. In this article, we will put Tasks of completely different types in the same table. These different Tasks may have the same status codes, for example, we use 0 to represent \"pending\". Therefore, we need a field to separate these Tasks, and this field is ``use_case_id``. We will ensure that all ``task_id`` under a ``use_case_id`` are unique. In this example, the use case ID is \"pdf_processing\". We don't have other use cases in this example. But by design, pynamodb_mate is able to manage many use cases in a single DynamoDB table.\n",
    "- **Execution Context (ctx)**: In our program design, we use Python's Context Manager to start a task's lifecycle and automatically update the status in the database based on the task's execution result (success or failure). This Execution Context is a container for all the contextual data in the lifecycle of executing a task, including any user data you need to save during the processing of this task.\n",
    "- **Execution**: The process of attempting to execute a task, which is the \"lifecycle\" of the task that has been mentioned many times above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's start writing some code to implement this use case.p"

    "The ``Task.start(...)`` method is the **CORE** of this best practice. It is a context manager where you can put your task execution logic under it. It does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It will set the status to the ``in_progress_status`` and set the lock. If the task is already locked, it will raise a ``TaskLockedError``.\n",
    "2. If the task succeeded, it will set the status to the ``succeeded_status``.\n",
    "3. If the task fail, it will set the status to the ``failed_status`` and log the error to ``.errors`` attribute, and add retry count.\n",
    "4. If the task failed N times in a row, it will set the status to the ``ignored_status``.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below is a \"happy path\". You can use ``with Step1.start(task_id=..., detailed_error(optional)=True | False, debug(optional)=True|False) as execution_context:`` to start the lifecycle of the task execution. The context manager will return a ``ExecutionContext`` object, which is a container for all the contextual data in the lifecycle of executing a task, including the instance of the DynamoDB ORM model (DynamoDB item), and allow you to use ``ExecutionContext.set_data()`` method to update any user data you need to save at the end of this task. \n"

    "To ensure that one task can be processed by one worker at a time, we need to use a concurrency lock. Essentially, a worker tries to acquire a lock when it is about to start an execution. If it fails to obtain the lock, it immediately raises a ``TaskIsLockedError``. Acquiring a lock is actually an update operation that sets a unique UUID as an attribute of the DynamoDB item. The worker who successfully acquires the lock must release it (unset the lock value) at the end of the execution. This is automatically handled by the ``start()`` context manager. If the worker fails to release the lock for any reason (e.g., power outage), the lock will automatically expire after a specified time. The expiration time is defined in the ``TrackerConfig``.\n"

    "You don't want a task that logically can never succeed to fall into an endless loop. For example, you may accidentally upload a video clip as the document, making it impossible to process it as a PDF. In this example, we defined the maximum number of retry attempts as 3. If a task fails 3 times in a row, it will be ignored. If you attempt to start a task that has been ignored, you will encounter a ``TaskIgnoredError``. During the 3 retry attempts, you will observe how the status changes and the retry count increases. You can also review the error history in the ``errors`` attribute."

    "## GSI Sharding on Status Attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "To query tasks by status code, we need to use a GSI (Global Secondary Index) that uses the status attribute as the hash key. However, the status attribute doesn't have good cardinality, as it only has 5 different values. If you have a large number of tasks, the GSI can become very unbalanced. We can use the [GSI Sharding technique](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GSI.html) to optimize this.\n",
    "\n",
    "In production, a healthy task execution system usually ends up with most tasks succeeded in history, a constant number of tasks in progress, and a small number of tasks in pending, failed, and ignored states. ``pynamodb_mate`` allows you to split succeeded tasks into many shards while keeping the other statuses in fewer shards. Since you need to query all shards and merge the results when performing a query, this strategy can make the GSI query more efficient when querying non-succeeded tasks (less shard to merge) and evenly distribute the succeeded tasks in the GSI.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `TrackerConfig` class has the following parameters to control the GSI sharding:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Step1(Task):\n",
    "    status_and_update_time_index = st.StatusAndUpdateTimeIndex()\n",
    "\n",
    "    config = st.TrackerConfig.make(\n",
    "        use_case_id=\"test\",\n",
    "        pending_status=Step1StatusEnum.pending.value,\n",
    "        in_progress_status=Step1StatusEnum.in_progress.value,\n",
    "        failed_status=Step1StatusEnum.failed.value,\n",
    "        succeeded_status=Step1StatusEnum.succeeded.value,\n",
    "        ignored_status=Step1StatusEnum.ignored.value,\n",
    "        n_pending_shard=5, # <--- number of shards\n",
    "        n_in_progress_shard=5, # <--- number of shards\n",
    "        n_failed_shard=5, # <--- number of shards\n",
    "        n_succeeded_shard=10, # <--- number of shards\n",
    "        n_ignored_shard=5, # <--- number of shards\n",
    "        status_zero_pad=3,\n",
    "        status_shard_zero_pad=3, # <--- number of zero pad for shard id\n",
    "        max_retry=3,\n",
    "        lock_expire_seconds=60,\n",
    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't have to explicitly specify the shard ID when using the ``Task.query_by_status(status=...)`` API. It will automatically query all shards and merge the results for you. However, if you really want to query a specific shard, you can use the GSI index object directly. The ``Task.make_value(...)`` method can help you generate the GSI hash key value."
